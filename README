Converts ITEX format as generated by the Hamamatsu streak camera
in Kobe to an ascii file.

This ITEX format differs slightly in the status string to the
specifications found online. Reading the scaling data may not
work with all .img files due to this.

Arguments:      <input file>
Outputs:        ascii table to standard output, status header to stderr.
To compile:     gcc main.c -o itex2ascii
